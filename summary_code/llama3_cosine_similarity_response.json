    "47823": "Message: For example, the Commission at one point says that it will \u201crequire the pipelines to show why their existing tariffs should not be considered unjust and unreasonable,\u201d Order No. 637-A at 31,591, and that \u201cindividual pipelines [will have] an opportunity to demonstrate that their own circumstances justify deviation from the general conclusion that segmentation is appropriate,\u201d FERC Br. at 101. INGAA\u2019s suspicion is also fueled by the fact that on several previous occasions the Commission had impermissibly blurred the distinction between \u00a7 4 and \u00a7 5, see Western Res., 9 F.3d at 1578 (\u201cWe now make it an even six\u201d times that the Commission failed to respect this distinction), or tried to use another section of the NGA to \u201ctrump\u201d its \u00a7 5 obligations, see Pub.
