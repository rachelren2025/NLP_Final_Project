# NLP_Final_Projectpyt
For this project, we used legal Q&A data from: // INSERT LINK TO DATA SOURCE

//INSERT LINKS TO WHERE WE SOURCED THESE MODELS 
We are running three different models:
    (1) Llama
    (2) Custom-Legal Bert
    (3) DeBERTa

After running these models we will analyze their results using three metrics:
    (1) Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
    (2) Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
    (3) F-1 score = 2 / ( (1 / Precision) + (1 / Recall) )

After analyzing these metrics, we created our own to better to suit the needs for the legal field:
    // INSERT THE FORMULA FOR OUR METRIC

Our formula improves upon... // INSERT THE PROS AND CONS OF OUR METRIC
