    "47821": "Message: even though the store benefitted from the advertising, the court found this did not rise to the level of consideration. Id. In State v. Socony Mobil Oil Co., the Court of Civil Appeals contrasted Brice with Cole and found no consideration where a filling station paid for bingo cards but gave them away free to any and all persons who came to their stations to request them, and a local TV station broadcast games in which bingo cards were used with winners being awarded cash prizes. 386 S.W.2d 169 (Tex.Civ.App.-San Antonio 1964). Some jurisdictions outside of the State of Texas have held that requiring a person to actually go to the location of the sweepstakes sponsor in order to participate constitutes consideration. See Lucky Calendar Co. v. Cohen, 19 N.J. 399, 117 A.2d 487, 496 (1955)(<HOLDING>); Knox Indus. Corp. v. State ex rel. Scanland,\n\nResponse: This case does not provide a relevant holding as the provided message is from unrelated cases, and appears to be only providing examples and citations rather than stating a specific legal principle or decision.",
    "47822": "Message: individuals are cooperating with law enforcement authorities.\u201d (Id.) As a general proposition, courts have repeatedly recognized that materials, including even judicial documents which are presumptively accessible, can be kept from the public if their dissemination might \u201cadversely affect law enforcement interests.\u201d Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1050; see also Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 120 (noting that the \u201cdanger of impairing law enforcement\u201d may be a countervailing factor outweighing the qualified right of access); Madoff, 626 F.Supp.2d at 427 (rejecting press access to emails sent by victims in a major fraud case, because \u201cdisclosing the details of the Government\u2019s efforts to obtain evidence will undoubtedly hamper the investigation\u201d); United States v. Park, 619 F.Supp.2d 89, 94 (S.D.N.Y.2009) (<HOLDING>). Thus, where public disclosure of certain materials might compromise ongoing law enforcement investigations or hinder the discovery of evidence, courts may withhold access to these documents to protect national security, prevent terrorism, or maintain public safety.\n\nResponse: Courts have the discretion to withhold access to judicial documents if their disclosure would likely cause harm to law enforcement efforts.",
    "47823": "Message: For example, the Commission at one point says that it will \u201crequire the pipelines to show why their existing tariffs should not be considered unjust and unreasonable,\u201d Order No. 637-A at 31,591, and that \u201cindividual pipelines [will have] an opportunity to demonstrate that their own circumstances justify deviation from the general conclusion that segmentation is appropriate,\u201d FERC Br. at 101.\n\nResponse: The court will require the pipelines to provide justification for their existing tariffs to be considered just and reasonable, allowing individual pipelines to present their unique circumstances as a basis for deviation from the general rule of pipeline rate segmentation."
