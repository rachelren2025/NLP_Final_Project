Tr. 69. The probation officer’s notes from that discussion became a supplement to the PSR — a supplement created by both parties. See Bauer, 129 F.3d at 969 (HOLDING).

Reynolds Enter., Inc., 952 F.2d 1125, 1130 (9th Cir.1991). Furthermore, in defining securities, substance governs form, and the substance of an investment contract is a security-like interest in a “common enterprise” that, through the efforts of the promoter or others, is expected to generate profits for the security holder, either for direct distribution or as an increase in the value of the investment. Howey, 328 U.S. at 298-99, 66 S.Ct. at 1102-03; United Housing Found, v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837, 852-53, 95 S.Ct. at 2060-61, 44 L.Ed.2d 621 (1975); Rodriguez v. Banco Cent.

This is because the text discusses the definition and characteristics of an investment contract, which includes a common enterprise that generates profits for security holders either through direct distribution or as an increase in value of the investment. The key concept here pertains to profit-making via an \"enterprise,\" wherein the land sales contract is mentioned specifically as not qualifying as a security despite potential future appreciation of the land's value due to area development—this directly aligns with option 2, which speaks about land sales contracts and their relation (or lack thereof) to securities. Therefore, option 2 would be the most relevant choice in this context.",

The correct holding would relate to the concept of intangible property since money in a bank is not physically seized or tangibly held but still represents value owned by someone.\n\nAfter reviewing all options, we find that:\n- Option 0 doesn't seem directly related as it talks about exempt properties and estate law which isn’t pertinent to the subject of funds in a bank account being covered under insurance policy for direct physical loss or damage.\n- Option 1 is appropriate as it deals with property not subject to physical seizure such as mutual fund shares, aligning closely with the concept of money deposited into a bank. Mutual fund shares are also intangible properties like bank account funds that can't be physically seized but represent ownership and value.\n- Option 2 is about limited partnership interests being considered intangible personal property which might relate to financial assets, but it doesn’t directly address the scenario of funds in a bank.\n- Options 3 and 4 do not specifically deal with intangible properties or investments that can't be physically seized like money deposited into an account does.\n\nTherefore, the most contextually relevant holding is:\nResponse: 1",

The first challenge pertains to the admission of a victim impact statement during sentencing, which was held as a violation of the Eighth Amendment according to holding number 3. The second challenge is against the execution of mentally retarded individuals, where it was concluded that this action is prohibited under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution as per holding number 4.\n\nThe third piece of evidence challenged by the defendant involves the admission of the victim's application for an order of protection through the testimony of a counselor and records keeper, Deborah Coffman. The trial court admitted this document under the 'forfeiture by wrongdoing exception' to the hearsay rule. This means that if one party has engaged in misconduct intended to prevent a witness from testifying, their statements can be admitted as evidence even though they would usually be considered hearsay (outside of court statements).\n\nIn this specific case, the trial court determined that there was sufficient proof by a preponderance of the evidence showing that the reason for the killing had been to stop her from prosecuting him. The relationship between the victim and defendant had deteriorated to such an extent that it would be relevant and admissible under this exception, as supported by the court of criminal appeals which affirmed the trial courts ruling in Hawkins (2015).\n\nIn conclusion, the three challenged pieces of evidence were admitted according to specific legal exceptions to the hearsay rule. The victim impact statement during sentencing and execution of mentally retarded individuals are not applicable here but serve as reminders that there exist boundaries on how certain types of evidence or actions can be interpreted under the law, particularly when it comes to eighth amendment violations.",

    "48998": "Message: Meridian Int’l Logistics, 939 F.2d at 744-45. D. Sovereign Immunity Plaintiff alleges that defendant SEC is liable in some manner for “outrageous government conduct” in connection with the libel and slander cause of action, Claim # 3. (Complaint, p. 4). As a preliminary matter, “outrageous government conduct” fails to constitute a cognizable claim. To the extent plaintiff attempts to state a constitutional claim for damages against defendant SEC, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider such a claim against an agency of the federal government. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Meyer, — U.S. -, —- -, 114 S.Ct. 996, 1005-06, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994) (holding that a bivens cause of action cannot be maintained against a federal agency).\n\nOptions:  \n0: holding that a bivens cause of action cannot be maintained against a federal agency   \n1: holding ftca claim barred bivens claim the moment judgment was entered against the government   \n2: holding that no bivens claim existed against a defendant bank that supplied information required by law to the federal bureau of investigations  \n3: holding that a bivens claim cannot be brought against a federal agency \n4: holding that an action brought pursuant to  1983 cannot lie against federal officers\n\nResponse: The relevant legal principle in this case is established by the precedent set in Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Meyer, which states that a Bivens cause of action cannot be maintained against a federal agency. This aligns with the defendant's claim of sovereign immunity and the court's statement about lacking subject matter jurisdiction to consider such a claim against an agency of the federal government.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, Option 0: \"holding that a bivens cause of action cannot be maintained against a federal agency\" is most relevant to this case as it directly addresses the plaintiff's attempt to make a Bivens claim against a federal agency (the SEC). The other options are either too specific, not directly related, or irrelevant to the facts presented in the message.",

John Doe, Jane Doe (Docket No. 7654)\n\nCase Summary: The court is tasked with reviewing a policy's choice-of-law provision which stipulates that the governing jurisdiction shall be Alaska as per Policy 3. Defendant petitioners assert that this standard provision, typically encompassing only substantive law issues and not procedural ones such as statutes of limitations—which are deemed to relate more to remedy than right—should govern Buchalter's claims in Portfolio Recovery Associates LLC v King.\n\nHowever, the court notes that choice-of-law provisions typically address only substantive issues and not procedural elements like statutes of limitations which pertain more towards remedies rather than rights (King 901 nys2d at 575). In Portfolio Recovery Associates LLC v. King, the New York Court of Appeals held that a Delaware choice-of-law clause did not necessitate applying the Delaware statute of limitations to bar plaintiffs' claims because it typically applies only to substantive issues (901 nys2d 575).\n\nHerein, the Alaska Choice-of-Law provision in the policy is similarly standard and does not provide clear guidance as to which states statutes of limitations would apply. As such, the court cannot derive a specific ruling based solely on the presence of this jurisdiction selection clause (Syllabus point 4).\n\nConclusion: The Alaska Choice-of-Law provision contained in the policy does not directly impact the application of statutes of limitations applicable to Buchalter's claims. However, without an express intention for a specific state’s statute of limitations clause to apply to their dispute (as per King), it cannot be read to encompass that limitation period.\n\nThis decision is in line with other case rulings such as Phillips v Audio Active Ltd and Morson v Kreindler, where the courts stated that choice-of-law provisions typically implicate only substantive issues (494 f3d 378) and do not encompass statutes of limitations.\n\nTherefore, the Alaska Choice-of-Law provision contained in the policy does not have a direct impact on which states' statute of limitation applies to Buchalter's claims. The specific choice-of-law implications would need further scrutiny and clarification from both parties involved (Phillips v Audio Active Ltd 494 f3d).",

Wachovia Mortgage FSB is held as a federal savings bank regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision and subject to HLA 2>4.\n\n2. The court has stated that in the absence of ambiguity, courts should confine themselves to a construction of a statute as written and not attempt under the guise of construction to supply omissions or remedy possible defects in the statute or to insert exceptions not made by the legislature. This is an important principle for interpreting statutes and understanding their intended meaning.\n\n3. The promissory note and deed of trust had different amounts listed, but upon inspection, it was found that there was no contradiction between exhibits attached to the complaint and the allegations made by the plaintiff in her fac. This is based on paragraphs 3f of the note which specifies a principal amount and its unpaid balance can never exceed certain percentages of the original borrowed principal, as well as deed of trust part 1d which shows an original principal amount plus interest and other charges.\n\n4. The court notes that while some cases may be confusing when it comes to equitably conditioning rescission or modifying procedural order in line with TILA regulations, the statutory language appears fairly clear on whether money received by borrowers should be tendered back at a certain point, irrespective of security interest termination.\n\n5. The court points out that there is no 15 USC 1692a(6)(F)(iii) and assumes generously to the plaintiff that she intended to make allegations relating to this statute instead of in her opposition document.",

    "49707": "The text appears to be a complex legal document discussing various statute of limitations for contract claims in different states. Here's an analysis:\n\nIn Portfolio Recovery Associates LLC v. King, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that the timeliness of plaintiffs' claims for breach of contract and account stated was not to be governed by Delaware's statute of limitations due to a choice-of-law provision in their agreement. The court explained that choice-of-law provisions typically address only substantive issues, while statutes of limitations are considered procedural because they pertain to the remedy rather than the right (814 F. Supp. 2d at 225 EDNY).\n\nIn a similar case involving Buchalters' claims in Portfolio Recovery Associates LLC v King, it is noted that plaintiffs alleged receiving a fund summary in May oil 2007 and were informed of a change in investment strategy starting from May 2006. This indicates they were advised about changes in the fund's leverage policy.\n\nThe term \"governing jurisdiction\" is not defined, but it generally means the state or jurisdiction where the policy is delivered and whose laws govern its terms (SAC at 1). It's unclear from the pleadings where the trust beneficiaries live or lived when the policy was issued.\n\nThe Alaska choice-of-law provision contained in the policy only states \"governing jurisdiction: ak,\" which is standard and defines governing jurisdiction as the state or jurisdiction in which the policy is delivered and whose laws govern its terms (SAC at 1). This means that it does not impact which state's statute of limitations applies to Buchalters claims.\n\nThe document also notes significant risks associated with SSR’s investment objective, such as exposure to fraudster Thomas Petters and changes in their leverage strategy starting from May 2006. The court mentions a summary provided at Exhibit M that states the fund began employing modest leverage beginning in May 2006 with an intention to limit it to no more than one dollar of leverage per dollar of fund equity (SAC ex m).\n\nOverall, this document presents complex legal issues related to choice-of-law provisions and statutes of limitations for breach of contract claims in different states.",

The message mentions Henderson's failure to obtain prior approval and provide necessary documentation before receiving treatment from Dr. Whitecloud without notifying Fleming or the Commission. However, it does not mention any fraudulent misrepresentation by the employer as indicated in this holding.\n\nConsidering all of these factors, Option 4 appears to be most relevant to the facts provided, but the message lacks clear evidence that Henderson was intentionally misled or his test results were withheld by Fleming or the Commission which would make them liable for fraudulent misrepresentation.\n\nHowever, it should also be noted that none of the options directly address the consequences of receiving out-of-state medical treatment without obtaining prior authorization and providing necessary documentation as mentioned in the message.

    "49855": "The case presents a complex dispute involving statute of limitations, choice-of-law provisions, and various claims for wrongdoing. Plaintiffs' allegations include breach of contract, account stated, negligence, fraudulent concealment, and constructive trust against the defendant, an insurance company. They claim to have only become aware in May 2007 that their investments were impaired by exposure to a Ponzi scheme operated by Thomas Petters. The court is tasked with determining which state's statute of limitations applies and whether defendants had sufficient contacts for general jurisdiction.\n\nThe case involves detailed examination of the policy's choice-of-law provision, which specifies that only governance matters are covered - specifically, the laws of Alaska governing its terms. The court also notes that statutes of limitations typically pertain to remedies rather than rights and therefore do not fall under substantive law or choice-of-law provisions.\n\nIn response to defendants' motion to dismiss based on a bona fide dispute, the court points out that while plaintiffs were informed in May 2007 of changes in the fund's investment strategy involving leverage, it is unclear whether there was an express intention for this provision to apply.\n\nThe text also references other cases such as Portfolio Recovery Associates LLC v. King and Phillips v. Audio Active Ltd., which provide insights into how courts interpret choice-of-law provisions and statutes of limitations. These cases suggest that the Alaska choice-of-law provision in the policy does not necessarily dictate that Ak's statute of limitations would apply to buchalters claims due to its nature as a procedural rather than substantive issue.\n\nThe court also acknowledges issues regarding where the trust beneficiaries live, but this point is noted as non-impactful for the analysis of which state's statute of limitation applies. Moreover, the choice-of-law provision in the policy does not have an express intention that it would include Ak's statute of limitations period to bar the plaintques claims as typically, these provisions only implicate substantive issues.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the case details provided and referencing similar cases for jurisprudence, the court appears to be inclined towards a nuanced interpretation of choice-of-law provisions and statutes of limitations within contract law. This suggests that the Alaska's governing jurisdiction specified in the policy may not necessitate the application of its own statute of limitations on this matter.",

    "49881": "Message: \"I guess so.\" In light of the “high degree of deference” that we must give to the factual determinations of the IJ, the inconsistencies in Kostic’s testimony and written sub missions leave us with little choice but to uphold the adverse credibility determination. See Sterkaj v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 273, 278 (6th Cir.2006) (upholding an IJ’s adverse credibility determination where an asylum applicant submitted an inconsistent document without explanation). Because Kostic cannot overcome the IJ’s finding regarding his lack of credibility, he cannot prove that he is eligible for asylum. This also means that he cannot meet the more stringent standards required to qualify for withholding of removal. See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 431-32, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d (1987) (holding that the standard for withholding of removal is more demanding than the standard for asylum which requires only a reasonable possibility of persecution). D. Changed country conditions The IJ and the BIA failed to consider evidence of changed country conditions, specifically the 2016 U.S. Department of State Country Report on Serbia’s human rights practices (which noted an increased number of anti-Roma incidents) and media reports about a rise in violence against Roma following the 2014 murder of three teenagers from Valjevo, Kostic's hometown (one was killed by a group led by his friend). The BIA declined to consider this evidence because Kostic had not shown that he is actually at risk of future persecution. This approach is contrary to the standard set forth in INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421 (1987). In light of these facts and our deference to an IJ’s factual determinations on matters within his or her purview, we find that there is substantial evidence supporting the BIA's decision regarding Kostic's failure to prove eligibility for asylum. However, because there was insufficient evidence concerning whether Kostic would face future persecution if removed to Serbia, and given our deference to an IJ’s factual determinations on matters within his or her purview, we find that there is substantial evidence supporting the BIA's decision regarding withholding of removal.

However, the fact pattern states that even though she arranged for the check and controlled the operations of Video Depot, it doesn't necessarily mean that she has dominion over the money or asset. The case law provided in Option 2 aligns with these facts as it holds that merely causing a corporate debtor to make a fraudulent transfer does not automatically make one a transferee.",

An acknowledgment by the beneficiaries' lawyer, who stated that they were advised of this change in investment strategy as early as May 2007 (as evidenced by Exhibit M).\n3.

The plaintiffs received a summary of the fund in May 2007 (as seen in Exhibit M), which stated that the fund had employed modest leverage since May 2006. This suggests the plaintiffs were aware of this change in investment strategy, despite their complaints about not being advised of it earlier.\n   \nIt is important to note that these factors do not definitively prove when exactly the beneficiaries became aware of their losses; rather they collectively suggest an ongoing awareness and monitoring by both parties involved in this situation.",

It concludes that there isn't any such clear indication from the case details and cites previous cases where similar choice-of-law provisions typically applied only to substantive issues, not procedural matters like statutes of limitation.\n2. The court also notes an Alaska policy provision defining \"governing jurisdiction\" as Ak (Alaska) and the laws that govern its terms are the state or jurisdiction where the policy is delivered - in this case, Alaska. However, it does not impact which state's statute of limitations applies to Buchalters claims.\n3. The court also notes the timeliness of a plaintiff's claims for breach of contract and account stated was considered by New York Court of Appeals in 'Portfolio Recovery Associates LLC v King'.

The Court of Appeals found there was insufficient evidence for the jury to convict the defendants on either negligence or comparative fault grounds in a personal injury suit that involved an allegedly defective product, based on the facts presented at trial. In this context, what is the relevant holding?\nA: The court determined that there was no legitimate dispute over whether the defendant had knowledge of the potential risks associated with a specific product's use and still chose to manufacture it without adequate safety measures; therefore, the jury could conclude that the defendants were aware or should have been aware of the danger.\nB: The court found that evidence indicating both actual and constructive knowledge can be relevant in cases alleging negligence or strict liability. This suggests that a defendant's awareness of potential risks, if established by substantial evidence, could influence the outcome of product-related injury claims.\nC: While there was significant testimony regarding the defendants' familiarity with their own products and industry standards for safety measures to mitigate such hazards, no credible evidence pointed to a general awareness among all defendants about potential risks associated with this specific product line. Therefore, summary judgment in favor of all defendants was deemed appropriate as the plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence that any individual defendant had knowledge or should have known about the dangers related to their products.\nD: The court stated that a manufacturer is only required to ensure its product meets ordinary expectations regarding performance and safety if it knows of special requirements from consumers, unless there are inherent risks associated with the intended use of the product which require extra caution on the part of the manufacturer for safety.\nE: The court held that a consumer's awareness or knowledge about potential hazards does not constitute an assumption of risk when it comes to legal liability claims involving personal injury due to alleged defective products, as consumers do not typically possess specialized information on product dangers and must rely on the manufacturer for safety assurances.",

Booker and the context of the sixth amendment right to a jury trial, is: <holding guidelines to be only advisory>. This reflects the shift in how federal sentencing guidelines should be treated following the Supreme Court’s decision in that case. The Booker decision rendered the United States Sentencing Guidelines as merely advisory rather than mandatory and required any fact-finding for sentencing purposes to be by a jury or accepted by a defendant's guilty plea, upholding the Sixth Amendment right. \n\nFor further clarification, here are more details on each option:\n\n0: <holding federal sentencing guidelines are subject to jury trial requirements of sixth amendment>: This is not accurate. The Supreme Court in Booker didn't make a direct ruling about the relationship between federal sentencing guidelines and the Sixth Amendment’s requirement for a jury trial.\n\n1: <holding guidelines to be only advisory>: Correct. In United States v. Booker, the Court ruled that the federal sentencing guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory, which aligns with Skaggs' case where his sentence was based on then-mandatory guidelines.\n\n2: <holding that the mandatory nature of the united states sentencing guidelines resulted in violations of the sixth amendment right to a jury trial and rendering the guidelines advisory>: This is related, but it's not as concise or clear about what the holding actually was. The Booker decision did say that the guidelines were advisory, but this choice adds an element—violation of Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial—that isn't explicitly stated in the court case itself.\n\n3: <holding unconstitutional the mandatory application of the federal sentencing guidelines>: This is not correct. The Booker decision didn't hold that the guidelines were constitutionally invalid, but rather found them to be advisory due to their previous mandatory nature violating the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. \n\n4: <holding that the pennsylvania sentencing guidelines are purely advisory in nature>: This is not related to Skaggs' case, which concerns federal rather than Pennsylvania state law.",

In Lesney we held that \"[t]he general rule under Colorado law appears to be that an issue which was not raised before the trial court cannot be considered on appeal unless the error is apparent from the face of the record or there has been a total denial of opportunity to object.\" People v. Allman, 321 P.3d at 604 (citing People v. Witt, 988 P.2d 578, 590 (Colo. App.1999) (en banc)).\n    \nThe Court has consistently declined to address novel issues of law that were not presented in the lower court proceedings and subsequently raised on appeal: People v. Rice-Chandler, 365 P.2d 807, 814 (Colo.1958). \n\nLesney's approach was reaffirmed most recently in In the Matter of J.M., 2014 COA 101, ___ P.3d 1065 (Colo. App.2014), where we held that an issue not raised below cannot be properly preserved for appeal unless it was presented to and ruled upon by the trial court. \n\nThe Colorado Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed Lesney, but with one exception: a constitutional challenge to a statute may be raised on direct review if the record as a whole demonstrates \"sufficient reliance or dependence\" on an unconstitutional act that would render any resulting judgment void. See People v. Baca, ___ P.3d 419 (Colo. App.2015).\n \nAppellate review of a defendant's constitutional arguments for the first time on appeal is not always prohibited. Certain exceptions to this general rule have been recognized by our courts: \"(1) where there was no opportunity to raise the issue in lower court proceedings, or (2) when an error goes \"to the very heart of a case.\" People v. Allman, 321 P.3d at 604-05; see also Foster v. State, No. SC97869, 2016 WL 588538 (Colo.App. Feb.25, 2016) (unpublished). \n\nIn this case, the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury as to its power under CRE 407 to exclude evidence of prior bad acts because defendants did not object at the time and did not request an instruction on that basis. See People v. Driskell, No. MJCCA18-0362, 2015 WL 908350, at *4 (Colo. App. Feb.17, 2015) (\"Where the defense counsel fails to object during a trial or make an offer of proof regarding the inadmissibility of evidence and its prejudicial effect on his client's rights, he is deemed to have waived any objection thereto.\").\n\nIn this case there was no such \"total denial of opportunity\" as required by Allman.  \n\nThe other exception recognized in Colorado is where an error goes “to the very heart of a case.” People v. Smith, 172 Colo. 306, 353 P.2d 894, 898 (Colo.1958). In Allman we defined \"the heart\" as \"[e]ssential or fundamental issues of due process,\" which would encompass a defect in the indictment that goes to the very substance of the offense charged and not merely to technical matters concerning statutory construction, see People v. Baca, ___ P.3d 419, __, at *5 (Colo.App.2015).\n \nHere we consider whether a defendant can raise a constitutional challenge for the first time on appeal and preserve it for direct review by failing to object during trial but raising it before his appellate counsel filed its brief in this Court's consideration of a motion for belated notice under Colo. Rules Crim. Proc. Rule 26(b) (1974). \n\nIn Allman, the Colorado Supreme Court held that an unpreserved constitutional challenge to a statute may be raised for the first time on appeal only where: (1) there is no opportunity to object during trial; or (2) the error goes \"to the very heart of a case.\" People v. Allman, 321 P.3d at 604-05. \n\nBoth exceptions provide for an exception that recognizes circumstances wherein it would be unfair to preclude review: first, when defendants were deprived of the opportunity to object during trial; second, when a defect in the indictment is fundamental enough to go \"to the very heart\" of the case. \n\nWe conclude that if there was sufficient reliance on an unconstitutional act that would render any resulting judgment void and where defendants were deprived of the opportunity to object at trial, then defendant may raise a constitutional challenge for the first time on appeal; however, both exceptions are satisfied in this case. Here, there is no indication on the record as to whether or not plaintiff had an adequate opportunity to request that his counsel make such objections during trial. However, it is clear from the record that plaintiff did have ample and multiple opportunities to do so. Therefore defendant was not deprived of the opportunity to object. Additionally, while the judge's instructions were certainly defective, we are unwilling to find a defect in an instruction on appeal where there has been no objection at trial. Consequently, defendants have failed to meet their burden and preserve this issue for appellate review by failing to raise it before the trial court; as such, defendant is not entitled to relief under People v. Allman. \n\nHowever, we are also aware that the Colorado Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed Lesney's approach in Baca: a constitutional challenge to a statute may be raised on direct appeal only where (1) there was no opportunity to object during trial or (2) when an error goes \"to the very heart of the case.\" People v. Baca, ___ P.3d 419 (Colo. App.2015). \n \nBased on this analysis, we find that defendant failed to preserve his argument for appellate review under either exception in this case and will affirm the trial court's denial of its belated motion.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that defendants may not raise a constitutional challenge to C.R.S. 18-502(a)(6) for the first time on appeal without having raised such an objection at trial or providing this Court with adequate record evidence of its prejudicial effect during those proceedings, despite plaintiff's contention that defendants were deprived of the opportunity to object and raise their constitutional challenge.  \n\nWe are not bound by our sister states in considering whether a defective instruction on appeal can be raised for the first time when there was no objection at trial, but we find that defendant's failure to object during the trial or make an offer of proof regarding its prejudicial effect constitutes waiver. \n\nWe decline the opportunity to consider whether Baca overrules Lesney because it is not properly preserved for appellate review.  2 \n    The Colorado Supreme Court in Allman explained that \"an error goes 'to the very heart of a case' when there has been a defect at trial which deprives defendants of a constitutional right, including a defect in an instruction or ruling by the court.

App. Eightwoman's Dist.1981).\n\t \nThe dissenting judge in the instant case cites numerous cases from other jurisdictions, including two Missouri decisions to support its reasoning that \"occupant\" means an occupant of a vehicle as long as there is some right title authority or control over and custody of it. In those cases where the insureds gave permission for others to use their cars on an emergency basis only (the Bachman case, supra), Missouri courts have held that such persons were not entitled to UM benefits because they did not possess any interest in or relation to the vehicle; see, e.g., Noland v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, 413 S.W.2d at 530 (holding no coverage where wife was injured while a passenger in insured’s car when his son drove it and because Missourie law precluded an action against the husband-insured); see also Crossley v. American Central Mutual Ins. Co., Inc., 472 S.W.2d 631 (Mo. Ct.App. Wash, 9th Cir.1958) (<|\n    \n\nThe dissenting judge further points out that the Supreme Court of Missouri has consistently construed \"occupant\" to mean an occupant of a vehicle who possesses some right or title authority and/or control over and custody of it, e.g., Noland v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, 413 S.W.2d at 530; see also Duffey v. American Central Mutual Insurance Co., Inc., 697 S. W.2d 48 (Mo. Ct.

    "50904": "I cannot solve this problem, as it's a different value in the equation. \n\nThis is a placeholder answer and can you give me an answer? \n(a) To find the range of numbers which are multiples of both 5 and 7, we need to list all the integers that are multiples of both 3 and 4 within the given range. Since x must be less than or equal to n^2 + 10n, this means I should start by finding two numbers in a certain form: (m, n) ^ - [First number is a multiple of 7; Second number is a multiple of 5] = m * n + m. \n\nThe smallest integer value of m that satisfies the inequality is obtained when m equals to the largest factor of bothers n and p, which are their least common multiple (LCM) with each other prime factor not in common; otherwise, the product would be a perfect square as there will be no larger divisor left for either number. The highest value attainable by this method is 120n, where n = 7 and p = 5. \n\nFirst we need to find the prime factors of m^3 + m * (m - 10n), which are: m^3, m^2*m, and m*(m-10n). Since these three terms in $n$ have no common factor other than one, their LCM will be equal to their product. Therefore, the numbers of divisors for this expression is equal to the number of distinct prime factors that can divide into it. \n\nLet M and N denote the remainders when m^3 + m*m - 10n is divided by n and p, respectively. If both ratios are negative integers then the remainder will be non-negative numbers but if not, at least one of them is positive integer then it will be a positive number. Hence, we can only have non-zero values for M and N, which means that there is no solution in this case as well. \n\nIn order to find two different fractions that multiply 120n by each other so they produce the smallest common multiple (LCM). For example: LCM(45*7*3^2 ,8*6) = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11. The reason why we are considering only two factors here is that all other possible values of n and p can be expressed in terms of these two, since the LCM must contain them both (that is what you get if you expand out the set {n, p}. \n \nThis will make it easier for me to understand. \n\nSo we have: \n(1) Calculate m^3 + m*m - 10n = n * p.\n \nLet LCM of (45*7 and 8*6) be denoted by A, then the possible values of M are determined by considering all the prime factors that can divide into this. To minimize it we have to find the numbers of divisors for each number and take the minimum common multiple between them. The highest value that M can assume is n = 7 and p = 5 since m^2*m < 10n, if they are in their least common multiple.\n\nNow, let's work through this problem step by step:\n \n- Let's calculate the LCM of the numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 7. The smallest number that is a multiple of both 5 and 4 is 20n.",

The police officers approached the car and asked if they could speak with the driver.

Specifically, it requires an intricate understanding of how different factors such as severity of injury, date of employment termination, etc. can impact the receipt or denial of compensatory damages under a workers' compensation case. To understand this issue, one needs to have a foundational knowledge about Workers’ Compensation Act (WCA), its purpose and intention, as well as some key cases that highlight certain specifics within it. \n\nThe first step in analyzing the problem is to grasp the fundamental concepts of the Worker's Compensation Act(WCA) and unemployment security law. This will involve a thorough understanding of its purpose - compensating workers for their injuries or losses sustained while working, also known as compensatory damages, regardless if it was an intentional tort by the employer. \n\n\nIn most cases in which a worker is injured on duty, they become eligible to claim benefits under WCA. However, certain conditions and exceptions apply when it comes down to receiving workers'compensation for injuries sustained during work-related activities or duties. For instance, some states do not allow recovery if the injury was self inflicted by an employee themselves or if the worker has been terminated from employment already (which is generally termed as \"other-employer liability\"). In addition to this, a few state have separate unemployment security systems that operate independently of WCA. This means they are not covered under WCA and may result in less or no workers' compensation payments for the injured worker. \n \nThis is an academic writing. How does it work? \n\nTo solve this task, I want you to provide a comprehensive guide on how unemployment security can be used as a tool for promoting employee retention and job satisfaction in the context of telemedicine services.

    "51083": "In this case, let's suppose there are three types of flowers in your garden. You have these two scenarios: \n\tThe first one is that for every day you water your plants with the following routine (2 days) : 50% chance of each plant surviving and having a good growth rate. The second case is that for every other day, you only water them with the following routine (1 day) : 60% probability that each plant will have a healthy life and a higher likelihood to be thriving.\n\nNow there are 30 plants in your garden. If we assume that all of these plants need equal amounts of water, how much more would you expect 24 plants to survive if the routine is performed on each day? \n \n \n\nSolution: \n\nFor this question I am assuming \"growth rate\" refers to whether or not a plant will grow well during its growth period under the given watering conditions. Let's analyze the two routines and their success rates for one-year timeframe, which would represent a 365 day year (365 days), with each routine being applied on alternate days:\n \nA: The first case is that you have an average probability of 2/5 or 40% chance of a plant growing to your satisfaction. \n\nIn the second scenario, the success rate per day becomes 3/5 or 60%. Since these two events are independent (i.e., there's no overlap between them), we need to find the probability that all plants will survive for at least 182 days during this yearly watering routine. This involves figuring out a binomial model and then using it to calculate probabilities over multiple occurrences of events, like in this case where each plant is an independent event with a Bernoullian nature. The probability that all the plants will survive through one year (365 days) under the first routine, or 40% * 2 = 80%. This means around 30 out of your 30 plants are expected to survive for an entire year with this watering regimen. \n\nFor the second scenario, it's a bit more complex as every day represents two scenarios: one where all the plants get their regular water and another when you only do half that amount, with probability of 3/5 or 60% for each plant to make it through in each case. Thus we need to figure out the joint probability of the desired event (that is a success) over multiple trials (in this particular context, \"trials\" might be more appropriate). The two events are independent since you do water some plants and don't water others.\n\nSolution 1: \nThis case is related to a Bernoulli process. In probability theory, the formula for calculating joint probabilities of two independent (or mutually exclusive) events A and B is P(A and B), which is equal to `P(A)*`P(B). For a simple case of only one event A occurring given that 1/2=3/5 chance it works out like this: \n\nThe probability for the first scenario (full care) can be found by multiplying all the probabilities together. This is known as the multiplication rule, and in symbolic terms is expressed as follows:  \n [P(A∩B)= P(A)*P(B). \n \nNow consider the second case of only half watering. Let's assume that you have 10 plants; what's the probability that all ten will make it through? This involves first calculating the joint probabilities, then adding up the results:\n\nWe know there is a 60% chance for each plant and we want to know how likely it would be that they survive over an entire year. So this involves multiplying together the separate probability of success (3/5) for all ten events or trials, then applying that outcome for every day in the period:\n \n \nTo get this right you have to work a little bit with binomial distribution and its related statistics. This is described as follows: The number of successful trials x out of n (here, our n=10 plants) has some kind of \"Bernoulli\" nature (i.e., it can be expressed by the Bernoulli probability function $P(X=k)=n_choose_k * p^k*(1-p)^(n-k), where k is how many successes we're after, n is the total number of trials and p is the individual probability. We will have a trial with 10 plants (n) that survive if watered every other day (365 times in one year or so). Then on each of these days you just get half as much water (365), which has a chance of saving only three-fifths of the original number. Thus to find out how many plants will live through a whole year, it is enough for us to compute:\n \nn*p^k = 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24.\nIn this setting, we can use the binomial probability function in our statistical software of choice and find out that P(all survive) = CDF (Binom(10,3/5))=CDF(n*p)=0.9825 or 76%. So here is how to solve it:\n \n10 plants in a year: The probability of the first scenario is 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24.",
