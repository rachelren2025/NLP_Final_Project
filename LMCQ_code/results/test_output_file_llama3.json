    "47866": "This appears to be a legal case file, containing various documents and information relevant to the lawsuit. The case involves Larry Buchalter, who is suing Portfolio Recovery Associates LLC (PRA) over allegations of breach of contract and account stated.\n\nThe case seems to revolve around an insurance policy issued by PRA to Buchalter's trust. The policy contains a choice-of-law provision stating that it will be governed by the laws of Alaska.\n\nBuchalter alleges that he received a summary of the fund in May 2007, which indicated that the fund began employing modest leverage starting in May 2006. This change in investment strategy appears to have been disclosed to Buchalter, although it is not clear where the trust beneficiaries live or lived at the time the policy was issued.\n\nThe case also mentions Thomas Petters, who allegedly operated a Ponzi scheme and had exposure to investment funds that Buchalter's trust invested in. PRA claims that they are taking legal action against Petters on behalf of Buchalter's trust.\n\nThe court notes that statutes of limitations apply differently depending on the jurisdiction. In this case, the choice-of-law provision in the policy does not impact the court's analysis as to which state's statute of limitations applies to Buchalter's claims.\n\nSome of the specific issues raised in the case include:\n\n1. Whether the summary provided to Buchalter in May 2007 was sufficient notice of the change in investment strategy.\n2. Whether PRA is entitled to legal action against Petters on behalf of Buchalter's trust.\n3. Which state's statute of limitations applies to Buchalter's claims.\n\nOverall, this case appears to involve a complex array of legal issues related to insurance policies, choice-of-law provisions, and statutes of limitations.",

As an initial matter, the magistrate judge’s decision not to address the claim is irrelevant to the question of whether this Court may address it on appeal.

The Penrod court suggests that the hen that is to be voided must be dealt with.

This is provided, we emphasize, that the holder of the hen participated in the reorganization. If he did not, his lien, would not be ‘property dealt with by the plan,’ and so the section would not apply.” Penrod, 50 F.3d at 463 (emphasis added).
