    "47822": "Message: individuals are cooperating with law enforcement authorities.\u201d (Id.) As a general proposition, courts have repeatedly recognized that materials, including even judicial documents which are presumptively accessible, can be kept from the public if their dissemination might \u201cadversely affect law enforcement interests.\u201d Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1050; see also Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 120 (noting that the \u201cdanger of impairing law enforcement\u201d may be a countervailing factor outweighing the qualified right of access); Madoff, 626 F.Supp.2d at 427 (rejecting press access to emails sent by victims in a major fraud case, because \u201cdisclosing the details of the Government\u2019s efforts to obtain evidence will undoubtedly hamper the investigation\u201d); United States v. Park, 619 F.Supp.2d 89, 94 (S.D.N.Y.2009) (<HOLDING>). Thus, where public disclosure of certain materials might compromise ongoing criminal investigations or law enforcement operations, courts may deny access to those materials in order to protect national security, prevent harm to individuals or the public, or maintain the integrity of the judicial process.\n\nResponse: The court is holding that materials containing information about ongoing criminal investigations can be kept from the public if their disclosure would \"adversely affect law enforcement interests\" and impede the government's ability to investigate crimes.",
